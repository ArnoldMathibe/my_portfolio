                Put simply, When you log into a website, you enter your username or email and password. This 
                information is then sent to server-side software, which ensures that your email looks like 
                an email address and your password is structured like a password. If everything looks good, 
                it sends the data to the database to ensure someone with that username and password exists. 
                Then, it chooses what's important and sends it back to you in the form of your user page.</p>
