                <h3>Front-End</h3>
                <img src="images/front-end.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Front end is a combination of two 
                    different elements: the graphic design (the look) 
                    and the user interface (the feel). Each of these is 
                    created independently, with most of the technical 
                    work going into the user interface using web languages 
                    like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>Back-End</h3>
                <img src="images/back-end.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Back-End is When you log into a website, you enter your username or email and password. This 
                    information is then sent to server-side software, which ensures that your email looks like 
                    an email address and your password is structured like a password. If everything looks good, 
                    it sends the data to the database to ensure someone with that username and password exists. 
                    Then, it chooses what's important and sends it back to you in the form of your user page.</p>
